        Data Deletion Request


Request for erasure of personal data

We retain and process minimal personal data of our users, all of which is pseudonymous data, being data relating to a single unidentified person. For our purposes, the data we collect includes a unique pseudonymous identifier (your User ID); your user preferences; and milestones related to your gameplay. This is set out in our privacy policy.

We are therefore unable to isolate your data from our other playersâ€™ pseudonymous data profiles without a means of connecting you to your respective profile. This is part of our effort to create products and services which are private by design. Once the game is deleted by a player, the User ID is lost and so there are no means by which we can deduce which profile is yours.

In accordance with our data retention policy, if the user profile is not accessed by a user for a period of time, it is moved to our inactive database. If after one year that data is still not used, it is permanently deleted.
